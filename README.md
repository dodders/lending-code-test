# lending-code-test

#Instructions

The solution requires python3 to run and processes the input data from:
    
    lending-code-test/data

which is loaded with the large data set.<p>
The repo contains both large and small data sets in these directories if you wish to test the solution on the small data set:

    lending-code-test/large
    lending-code-test/small

To run the solution, clone the repo and navigate to the root directory:

    cd lending-code-test
    
Assuming python3 is in your path:

    lending-code-test: ./run.sh
